## 1. Introduction
ThreadSense ("we", "our", or "us") provides a Chrome Extension and Web Platform designed to summarize and analyze Reddit threads using Artificial Intelligence. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.

## 2. Data We Collect
We collect the minimum amount of data required to provide our services:

### A. User-Provided Information
*   **Account Information:** When you sign up, we collect your username and email address to manage your subscription and history.
*   **Authentication Tokens:** We store a secure token in your local browser storage to keep you logged in.

### B. Automated Data Collection (Extension)
*   **Page Content:** When you explicitly click "Summarize" or "Analyze", our extension reads the text content of the current Redit page.
*   **URLs:** We process the URL of the Reddit thread you are analyzing to fetch metadata and comments.

**Important:** We do NOT track your browsing history. The extension only activates and captures data when you specifically request an analysis on a supported site (Reddit).

## 3. How We Use Your Data
*   **AI Processing:** The text content you submit is sent to our backend servers to be processed by our AI models (e.g., Ollama) for summarization and sentiment analysis.
*   **Service Delivery:** To display the summaries, insights, and history logs back to you.

## 4. Data Sharing
We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with:
*   **Service Providers:** We may use third-party hosting (e.g., Render, Vercel) to run our infrastructure. Use of their services is subject to their respective privacy policies.

## 5. Data Security
We implement industry-standard security measures, including HTTPS encryption for all data in transit and secure database storage for your history logs.

## 6. Your Rights
You have the right to request the deletion of your account and all associated data at any time by contacting us at the email provided above.
